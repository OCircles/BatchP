CMD when using set /a

	It sets a signed 32 bit int
	You cannot use set /a higher or lower than 2147483647 and -2147483648

	If you peform
	
	When doing operations this applies:

	- If the variable doesn't exist, it will be created (initialized at 0)

		Example:
			
			set /a thisDoesntExist+=1
			
			Then thisDoesntExist will equal 1
			
	- If it exceeds the int32 limit It will wrap the number around:

		Example:
	
			set /a X=2147483647
			set /a X+=1

			X will now be equal to 2147483647
			Where X+=2 X would equal -21474836488

		There is a limit to this 

Highest set /a is 	2147483647
Lowest set /a is	-2147483648
